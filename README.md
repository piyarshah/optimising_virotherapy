**Oncolytic Virotherapy Optimisation**

This project models and optimises tumour treatment schedules using oncolytic viruses, inspired by Beata Halassyâ€™s breast cancer treatment. The code implements mathematical models, grid search, and genetic algorithms to refine timing and dosage for effective treatment outcomes.

**Features**

Tumour Growth Modelling: Uses a logistic growth model with exponential decay for tumour volume prediction.

Grid Search Optimisation: Identifies optimal timing for MeV and VSV injections.

Genetic Algorithm: Refines dosage combinations for maximum tumour reduction.

Visualisation: Graphs tumour size progression and dosage evolution over time.

**How to Run**
1. Install dependencies:

pip install numpy scipy matplotlib

2. Run the tumour growth and decay model:

python tumor_model.py

3. Run the grid search for optimal timing:
   
python grid_search.py

4. Run the genetic algorithm for dosage optimisation:

python genetic_algorithm.py

**Results**

- Optimal timing and dosage strategies are printed in the console.
- Visualisations display tumour size progression and dosage evolution.

**Notes**

Parameters like tumour size, viral decay rates, and dosage ranges can be modified within the code for further experimentation.

The project serves as a starting point for refining oncolytic virotherapy model
